# Web Visualization Dashboard

In this project I utilized Python libraries (requests, citipy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, datetime)and the OpenWeatherMap API to collect and analyze weather data from over nine hundred randomly selected cities worldwide (each point in the longitude vs. latitude scatterplot above represents a city analyzed). For all weather parameters analyzed (temperature, wind, humidity, and wind speed) temperature was the most strongly correlated to latitude.

The webpage created (https://vp1030.github.io/WebVisualizationDashboard/) contains source data as well as visualizations showing the correlation (or lack of correlation) between latitude and four different weather parameters.
